# hello-world
I'm just following the GitHub instructions and creating this repo. I'm a beginner developer who is just now getting into the fundamentals of programming.
I love tater-tots and puppies. I'm hoping to complete school and gain the basic knowledge to be able to begin my career in the computer programming field.
